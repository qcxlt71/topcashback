# TopCashback Review: Get Paid to Shop Online, Earn More Cashback Than Anywhere Else

So I have a friend — let's call her Maya — who spent three years buying everything online without once getting a single cent back. Full price, every time. She didn't know about cashback sites, and honestly, she thought they sounded like a scam anyway.

Then one day she signed up for TopCashback on a whim, got $30 back on a hotel booking she was going to make regardless, and now she won't shut up about it. Fair enough, honestly.

If you've never used a cashback site before, or you've been using one of the more well-known ones and wondering if you're leaving money on the table — this one's for you.

## What Is TopCashback, Exactly?

TopCashback is a cashback rewards platform. The idea is simple: you go through their site before you shop at a store, and TopCashback earns a referral commission from that retailer. Then they pass most (or all) of that commission back to you as cashback.

It's not magic. It's not a scam. It's just a slightly different way to reach a store you were going to visit anyway — and get paid for it.

TopCashback was founded in the UK in 2005 and has grown into one of the largest cashback platforms in the world. Their big pitch — and the thing that actually sets them apart — is that they aim to offer the **highest cashback rates** in the market, often higher than competitors like Rakuten or Swagbucks.

They partner with **thousands of retailers** across travel, fashion, electronics, insurance, subscriptions, and more. We're talking names like Nike, Booking.com, Walmart, Apple, Sephora, Expedia, and literally hundreds more.

## Why TopCashback Stands Out

Here's the thing: there are a lot of cashback sites. So why bother switching or starting with this one?

**1. Higher rates, genuinely.**
TopCashback frequently tops comparison charts for cashback percentages. Where a competitor might offer 2% at a retailer, TopCashback might have 4-6%. Over a year of regular shopping, that gap adds up.

**2. They have a free membership tier that's actually good.**
You don't need to pay anything to start earning. The free (Classic) tier gets you solid cashback on thousands of stores. There's also a Plus membership with extra perks if you want to go deeper.

**3. No cap on earnings.**
Some platforms limit how much you can earn per transaction or per year. TopCashback doesn't play that game — earn as much as your shopping warrants.

**4. New member bonuses.**
They regularly run sign-up bonuses where new members can earn a guaranteed cashback amount on their first purchase. It's essentially free money for doing something you were going to do anyway.

## TopCashback Membership Tiers

| Feature | Classic (Free) | Plus (Paid) |
|---|---|---|
| Access to cashback offers | ✅ | ✅ |
| Higher cashback rates | — | ✅ (up to 5% extra) |
| Priority customer support | — | ✅ |
| Exclusive member-only deals | — | ✅ |
| Referral bonus boosts | Standard | Enhanced |
| Annual fee | $0 | ~$5/month or $47.99/year |

For most people, the **Classic tier is more than enough** to start. You can always upgrade later if you find yourself shopping through the platform regularly. The Plus membership pays for itself quickly if you make even one or two medium-sized purchases per year.

## How It Actually Works (Step by Step)

1. **Sign up** for a free account at TopCashback
2. **Search** for the store you want to shop at
3. **Click through** to that store via the TopCashback link
4. **Shop as normal** — same prices, same checkout
5. **Cashback gets tracked** and added to your account
6. **Withdraw** to your bank, PayPal, or as gift cards (often at a bonus rate)

The cashback usually takes a few days to show as "pending" and a few weeks to confirm, depending on the retailer's return policy window. That's totally normal and how every cashback platform works.

## What Can You Earn Cashback On?

Pretty much anything you'd buy online. Here's a sense of the range:

| Category | Example Retailers | Typical Cashback Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Fashion & Apparel | Nike, ASOS, Gap, Levi's | 3–10% |
| Travel & Hotels | Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com | 3–8% |
| Electronics | Best Buy, Newegg, Samsung | 1–4% |
| Beauty & Health | Sephora, iHerb, Ulta | 3–7% |
| Insurance | Various providers | Up to $50–$100 flat |
| Subscriptions | NordVPN, Adobe, Coursera | 10–30%+ |
| Home & Garden | Wayfair, Home Depot | 2–5% |
| Financial Services | Credit cards, banking | Flat bonuses up to $200 |

Financial services and insurance categories are where you can earn flat-rate bonuses that are genuinely impressive — if you're already planning to open a new account or switch providers, doing it through TopCashback can net you serious money.

## Real Talk: The Catch?

There isn't a dramatic catch, but here are the honest caveats:

- **Cashback takes time to confirm.** You won't see instant cash. Usually 30–90 days depending on the merchant.
- **You have to remember to click through.** If you go directly to the retailer, you get nothing. The habit takes a few weeks to build.
- **Some transactions don't track.** Ad blockers, coupon codes from third parties, or clearing cookies before purchase can sometimes mess with tracking. Standard advice: disable your ad blocker when clicking through, and use only the retailer's own promo codes.
- **Rates can change.** What's 6% today might be 3% next month. Check before each purchase.

None of these are dealbreakers. They're just the reality of how cashback platforms work.

## Is TopCashback Legit?

Yes. Genuinely yes. They've been around since 2005, have millions of members globally, and have paid out hundreds of millions in cashback. They have a solid Trustpilot rating and an established reputation in both the UK and US markets.

The occasional hiccup with a tracked transaction is normal for any cashback platform — what matters is that TopCashback has a customer support team that actually handles missing cashback claims, which not all platforms do well.

## Tips to Maximize Your Earnings

**Stack cashback with credit card rewards.** Use a rewards credit card through TopCashback and you're earning on two fronts simultaneously.

**Check TopCashback before any big purchase.** Travel, electronics, appliances — these are where single transactions can earn you $10–$50+ back.

**Gift card boosting.** When withdrawing your cashback, sometimes choosing a gift card option instead of cash gives you an extra 5–10% bonus. Worth checking before you withdraw.

**Refer friends.** You earn a referral bonus when friends sign up and make their first purchase. If you have a group chat of online shoppers, this is easy money.

## Bottom Line

TopCashback is one of those things that sounds mildly interesting until you actually use it, at which point you wonder why you weren't doing it for the past decade.

You shop. They pay you back. The stores pay TopCashback for sending them customers. Everybody wins except for slightly your impulse to buy things, because now you're more likely to buy things to earn cashback.

But look — you were going to buy that stuff anyway. You might as well get paid.
